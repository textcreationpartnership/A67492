            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

During which time, either through his remiſs Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe being not mindful of thoſe Kingdoms and Provinces, which had ſorn Allegiance unto him, they revolt from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, infomuch, that after his Deceaſe, the ſucceeding Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Octavian Auguſtus, Tiberius Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Cajus Caligula,</hi> thought it more Prudence, carefully to preſerve what they had already gotten, rather than uncertainly to graſp at any more: By which means <hi>Britain</hi> was left, as it were, almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; until one <hi>Bericus,</hi> a Noble-man, Born in <hi>Britain</hi> (who for Sedition, and other high Miſdemeanours, was expel'd his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country) greatly ſolicited <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Drucis,</hi> who was newly choſen Emperour, by the Pretorian Souldiers (<hi>Ann.

               <p>The Succeſs of whoſe War, according to <hi>Dion,</hi> was the taking of <hi>Camolodunum,</hi> (now <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi>) the chief Seat of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings; the Subjection of that part thereof next the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the diſarming of the Inhabitants, and the placing of a Colony of old <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers therein, <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> being the firſt that ever fixed a compleat Conqueſt in <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Things being happily atchiev'd, <hi>Ceſar,</hi> at the End of ſix Months, returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving <hi>Publius Oſtorius Scapula,</hi> his <hi>Praetoria,</hi> (or Deputy) to end the War; who ſoon reduced the higher Part of <hi>Britain</hi> into the Form of a <hi>Roman</hi> Province; taking the <hi>Dobunies</hi> (who then poſſeſs'd <hi>Oxford ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire,</hi>) into his Protection.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtorians (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth, Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi> and Others relate theſe Things far otherwiſe; ſaying, That <hi>Arviragus,</hi> the Youngeſt Son of <hi>Cunobeline,</hi> (nor <hi>Togodumus</hi>) was King of the <hi>Britains, Ann. Dom.</hi> 45. In which Year, (ſay they) <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> came in Perſon againſt <hi>Britain,</hi> who, when he could not obtain it by Force of Arms, came to a Compoſition with <hi>Arviragus,</hi> and gave him his Daughter <hi>Jenniſſa</hi> in Marriage, which Marriage, (ſay they) was conſummated at <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> Hereupon King <hi>Arviragus,</hi> to make the Town more famous, where this Marriage was ſolemnized, did not only Beautify the ſame, but he likewiſe greatly Enlarged it with new Buildings, and gave it the Name of <hi>Claudia-Caſtria,</hi> or (<hi>Caſtrum,</hi>) alluding to <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi>'s Name.</p>
               <p>But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> an approved Author, tells you, that theſe were idle Fables, begun by <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and carried on by their Hiſtorians, and Commentators, Men altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant and unskilful in Antiquity, whoſe Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is ſo much to be doubted, that no Man of Senſe will give any Credit to them.</p>
               <p>Now Dr. <hi>Plott,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> (pag. 135.) ſaith, That if it be urged out of <hi>Ponticus Virinius,</hi> and ſome Others, that the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> was at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and that he either Enlarged, or Built that City, after his own Name, in Memory of the Marriage of his Daughter <hi>Jenniſſa,</hi> with <hi>Arviragus,</hi> the then King of the <hi>Britains:</hi> Nevertheleſs (ſaith he) it muſt be anſwered, That notwithſtanding the Name of <hi>Claudius-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum,</hi> (now <hi>Glouceſter</hi>) yet, in all likelihood, there was never any ſuch Matter; for neither <hi>Suetonius</hi> nor <hi>Dion,</hi> (who both lived
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45265:3"/>in his time, and had each of them born the Office of Conful,) do make mention of any ſuch Name as <hi>Jenniſſa,</hi> or that ſhe was ſo diſpoſed of by him in Marriage, altho' they both do number up how many Children <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> had. Beſides all this, the Dr. further adds, How was it poſſible that <hi>Claudius Ceſar,</hi> who came hither, and returned back to <hi>Rome</hi> in ſix Months, ſhould have ſo much time as to come to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> being a Place far in the Country, much more to build or re-edify that City? For <hi>Dion</hi> expreſly faith, that <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> was but ſixteen Days in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and in all Probability, thoſe ſixteen Days were ſpent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Army, and that <hi>Arviragus</hi> was not known to <hi>Claudius Ceſar,</hi> but that he rather lived in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> the ſixth in Succeſſion after him.</p>
               <p>Now altho' it cannot be certainly proved (by any reputable Author) who was <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s firſt Founder, yet moſt certain it is, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did Build it, and that of ſet Purpoſe to be like a Yoke, as it were, upon the Necks of the <hi>Silures,</hi> a fierce and warlike People, who then poſſeſs'd all that Tract of Ground, which lieth between the two great Rivers, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> called by the ancient <hi>Britains, Vaga,</hi> and <hi>Hafferne,</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to curb their violent Incurſions. And it is altogether as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> gave it the Name of <hi>Glevum,</hi> and that he there planted a Colony of <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, which were called, according to <hi>Ptolomy, Coloni-Glevum</hi> (or the <hi>White Colony</hi>) and to confirm the ſame, the learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> in his former Treatiſe ſaith, (fol. 36.) That there was an ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, found upon a Quadrant Stone in the Walls of <hi>Bath,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Dec. Colonia</hi> Glev. <hi>vixit, Ann.</hi> LXXXVI.</p>
               <p>It farther appears, that after the Exturpation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Saxons</hi> gave it the Name of of <hi>Glav-ceſter,</hi> which Word, according to <hi>Ninius,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> well obſerveth) came from <hi>Glev,</hi> and ſo proportionably <hi>Glevum,</hi> from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Caire-Glow,</hi> which ſignifieth, white, fair, or ſplendid; derived or taken from the High Duke <hi>Glovi,</hi> or <hi>Glovis,</hi> Great-Grandfather to King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> from whence <hi>Glovernia,</hi> after whom, the <hi>Latines</hi> called it <hi>Glouceſtriae,</hi> and the Vulgar <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Having thus far ſpoken of its Original Foundation, and Name, come we, in the next place, to treat of the Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it had in the time of the <hi>Britains,</hi> with other Remarks to the Conqueſt, and from thence you have Variety of Obſervations, to the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who made it a City.</p>
               <p>I find nothing recorded, by any reputable Author, concerning the City, or Town, of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> during the time that the <hi>Romans</hi> were here in <hi>Britain:</hi> Neither have I met with any thing that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45265:4"/>may be termed remarkable, till the coming in of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Pagan Saxons,</hi> who, through their perfidious Treachery, ſlew four Hundred and Sixth of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility upon the Plain of <hi>Amsbury,</hi> within three Miles of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> at a Place called ſince <hi>Stone-Henge;</hi> which Stones are ſaid to have been there erected as a Monument, or Memorial of that moſt bloody and barbarous Slaughter. Amongſt whom, at that time, was the valiant <hi>Eldol,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Brother unto <hi>Eldade,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter:</hi> Who finding of a Stake, which by chance lay on the Ground, He, with his own Hands, ſlew (according to Sr. <hi>William Dugdale</hi>) Seventeen of thoſe <hi>Saxons,</hi> and afterwards made his Eſcape to his Dukedome of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where he raiſed what Forces he could procure, and at Place called <hi>Maezbel,</hi> on the North of <hi>Humber,</hi> meets with <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> gives him Battle, and defeats his Army, (<hi>Cambden</hi> out of <hi>Higden,</hi> ſol. 208.).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aethelſtan,</hi> the <hi>25th</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> Died at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> but was Buried at <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in <hi>Wilt-ſhire, Ann. Dom.</hi> 940.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor held a famous Parliament at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1503. During which time <hi>Gruffith,</hi> King of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> Rebelled; and, with thirty Sail of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ships, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the River <hi>Severn,</hi> doing great Spoil to the Country: But at laſt he was taken at <hi>Bullen-Dane,</hi> the ſame we now call <hi>Bully,</hi> and there Beheaded, and afterwards his Head was preſented to King <hi>Edward,</hi> at <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
